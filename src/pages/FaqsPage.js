        How many tickets can I mint?
        In order to allow for fairness and an opportunity for the community to grow, we will limit it to five tickets per mint. Although you will be able to purchase more as they migrate to secondary marketplaces.

        What do I do if I have a winning ticket?
        Each winning ticket will include specific instructions to follow in order to guarantee receipt of the item. TLAC will coordinate hand delivery of all assets.
